## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I did repeat a lot of the same previous learnings, such as CSS Flexbox, and organizing layouts. This time I did make use of REM units for pixel sizes as I was told that it improves accessibility. I learnt a lot more about optimizing layouts for various screen sizes, which is reflected in the multiple media queries that I created. Lastly, I made use of a table, something that I've only ever done on Freecodecamp.

### Continued development

Regarding the REM units, I feel like I overdid the use of the REM units for the font, margin, and paddings sizes. Some feedback regarding that would be helpful. Also since this was the first time I implemented a table other than on Freecodecamp, I wasn't sure too sure on how I could adjust the size between the first and second columns so advice is appreciated.
